Built similarly to <a href=https://github.com/Koldenblue/mern-redux-auth-template>this template</a>, also by the author. See the readme at that page for a detailed discussion of this template, as well as a sample deployed website. This template sets up material-ui as a styling library, rather than react-bootstrap.

## Discussion
This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). For styling, a Sass file structure has been set up. The withStyles library from Material-UI has also been set up.

An Express.js backend has been set up in order to handle requests to a Mongo database. This backend currently handles user authentication functions.
